  # unit tests for admin_accept_o_auth2_consent_request
  # Accept an OAuth 2.0 Consent Request
  # When an authorization code, hybrid, or implicit OAuth 2.0 Flow is initiated, ORY Hydra asks the login provider to authenticate the subject and then tell ORY Hydra now about it. If the subject authenticated, he/she must now be asked if the OAuth 2.0 Client which initiated the flow should be allowed to access the resources on the subject&#39;s behalf.  The consent provider which handles this request and is a web app implemented and hosted by you. It shows a subject interface which asks the subject to grant or deny the client access to the requested scope (\&quot;Application my-dropbox-app wants write access to all your private files\&quot;).  The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The consent provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then tells ORY Hydra if the subject accepted or rejected the request.  This endpoint tells ORY Hydra that the subject has authorized the OAuth 2.0 client to access resources on his/her behalf. The consent provider includes additional information, such as session data for access and ID tokens, and if the consent request should be used as basis for future requests.  The response contains a redirect URL which the consent provider should redirect the user-agent to.

  # unit tests for admin_accept_o_auth2_login_request
  # Accept an OAuth 2.0 Login Request
  # When an authorization code, hybrid, or implicit OAuth 2.0 Flow is initiated, Ory Hydra asks the login provider (sometimes called \&quot;identity provider\&quot;) to authenticate the subject and then tell Ory Hydra now about it. The login provider is an web-app you write and host, and it must be able to authenticate (\&quot;show the subject a login screen\&quot;) a subject (in OAuth2 the proper name for subject is \&quot;resource owner\&quot;).  The authentication challenge is appended to the login provider URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The login provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then accept or reject the requested authentication process.  This endpoint tells ORY Hydra that the subject has successfully authenticated and includes additional information such as the subject&#39;s ID and if ORY Hydra should remember the subject&#39;s subject agent for future authentication attempts by setting a cookie.  The response contains a redirect URL which the login provider should redirect the user-agent to.

  # Reject an OAuth 2.0 Consent Request
  # When an authorization code, hybrid, or implicit OAuth 2.0 Flow is initiated, ORY Hydra asks the login provider to authenticate the subject and then tell ORY Hydra now about it. If the subject authenticated, he/she must now be asked if the OAuth 2.0 Client which initiated the flow should be allowed to access the resources on the subject&#39;s behalf.  The consent provider which handles this request and is a web app implemented and hosted by you. It shows a subject interface which asks the subject to grant or deny the client access to the requested scope (\&quot;Application my-dropbox-app wants write access to all your private files\&quot;).  The consent challenge is appended to the consent provider&#39;s URL to which the subject&#39;s user-agent (browser) is redirected to. The consent provider uses that challenge to fetch information on the OAuth2 request and then tells ORY Hydra if the subject accepted or rejected the request.  This endpoint tells ORY Hydra that the subject has not authorized the OAuth 2.0 client to access resources on his/her behalf. The consent provider must include a reason why the consent was not granted.  The response contains a redirect URL which the consent provider should redirect the user-agent to.

  # This endpoint returns a registration flow&#39;s context with, for example, error details and other information.  Browser flows expect the anti-CSRF cookie to be included in the request&#39;s HTTP Cookie Header. For AJAX requests you must ensure that cookies are included in the request or requests will fail.  If you use the browser-flow for server-side apps, the services need to run on a common top-level-domain and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/registration&#39;, async function (req, res) { const flow &#x3D; await client.getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow(req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;), req.query[&#39;flow&#39;])  res.render(&#39;registration&#39;, flow) }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  This request may fail due to several reasons. The &#x60;error.id&#x60; can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;self_service_flow_expired&#x60;: The flow is expired and you should request a new one.

  # Get Settings Flow
  # When accessing this endpoint through Ory Kratos&#39; Public API you must ensure that either the Ory Kratos Session Cookie or the Ory Kratos Session Token are set.  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  You can access this endpoint without credentials when using Ory Kratos&#39; Admin API.  If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The flow was interrupted with &#x60;session_refresh_required&#x60; but apparently some other identity logged in instead.

  # unit tests for patch_project
  # Patch an Ory Cloud Project Configuration&#x60;
  # Deprecated: Use the &#x60;patchProjectWithRevision&#x60; endpoint instead to specify the exact revision the patch was generated for.  This endpoints allows you to patch individual Ory Cloud Project configuration keys for Ory&#39;s services (identity, permission, ...). The configuration format is fully compatible with the open source projects for the respective services (e.g. Ory Kratos for Identity, Ory Keto for Permissions).  This endpoint expects the &#x60;version&#x60; key to be set in the payload. If it is unset, it will try to import the config as if it is from the most recent version.  If you have an older version of a configuration, you should set the version key in the payload!  While this endpoint is able to process all configuration items related to features (e.g. password reset), it does not support operational configuration items (e.g. port, tracing, logging) otherwise available in the open source.  For configuration items that can not be translated to Ory Cloud, this endpoint will return a list of warnings to help you understand which parts of your config could not be processed.

  # unit tests for submit_self_service_login_flow
  # Submit a Login Flow
  # :::info  This endpoint is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to potential breaking changes in the future.  :::  Use this endpoint to complete a login flow. This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows.  API flows expect &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and responds with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the session token on success; HTTP 410 if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set and optionally a &#x60;use_flow_id&#x60; parameter in the body; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  Browser flows expect a Content-Type of &#x60;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#x60; or &#x60;application/json&#x60; to be sent in the body and respond with a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after login URL or the &#x60;return_to&#x60; value if it was set and if the login succeeded; a HTTP 303 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.  Browser flows with an accept header of &#x60;application/json&#x60; will not redirect but instead respond with HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a &#x60;Set-Cookie&#x60; header on success; HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set; HTTP 400 on form validation errors.  If this endpoint is called with &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the case of an error, the &#x60;error.id&#x60; of the JSON response body can be one of:  &#x60;session_already_available&#x60;: The user is already signed in. &#x60;security_csrf_violation&#x60;: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred. &#x60;security_identity_mismatch&#x60;: The requested &#x60;?return_to&#x60; address is not allowed to be used.

If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/protected-endpoint&#39;, async function (req, res) { const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(undefined, req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;))  console.log(session) }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example ... const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(\&quot;the-session-token\&quot;)  console.log(session) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking  if the &#x60;Cookie&#x60; HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the &#x60;Authorization: bearer &lt;ory-session-token&gt;&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The &#x60;error.id&#x60; can be one of:  &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token). &#x60;session_aal2_required&#x60;: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :x_session_token Set the Session Token when calling from non-browser clients. A session token has a format of &#x60;MP2YWEMeM8MxjkGKpH4dqOQ4Q4DlSPaj&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :cookie Set the Cookie Header. This is especially useful when calling this endpoint from a server-side application. In that scenario you must include the HTTP Cookie Header which originally was included in the request to your server. An example of a session in the HTTP Cookie Header is: &#x60;ory_kratos_session&#x3D;a19iOVAbdzdgl70Rq1QZmrKmcjDtdsviCTZx7m9a9yHIUS8Wa9T7hvqyGTsLHi6Qifn2WUfpAKx9DWp0SJGleIn9vh2YF4A16id93kXFTgIgmwIOvbVAScyrx7yVl6bPZnCx27ec4WQDtaTewC1CpgudeDV2jQQnSaCP6ny3xa8qLH-QUgYqdQuoA_LF1phxgRCUfIrCLQOkolX5nv3ze_f&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x60;.  It is ok if more than one cookie are included here as all other cookies will be ignored.

  # unit tests for update_project
  # Update an Ory Cloud Project Configuration
  # This endpoints allows you to update the Ory Cloud Project configuration for individual services (identity, permission, ...). The configuration is fully compatible with the open source projects for the respective services (e.g. Ory Kratos for Identity, Ory Keto for Permissions).  This endpoint expects the &#x60;version&#x60; key to be set in the payload. If it is unset, it will try to import the config as if it is from the most recent version.  If you have an older version of a configuration, you should set the version key in the payload!  While this endpoint is able to process all configuration items related to features (e.g. password reset), it does not support operational configuration items (e.g. port, tracing, logging) otherwise available in the open source.  For configuration items that can not be translated to Ory Cloud, this endpoint will return a list of warnings to help you understand which parts of your config could not be processed.  Be aware that updating any service&#39;s configuration will completely override your current configuration for that service!
